## Problem Description
Grocery stores often have a difficult task: they must determine how many employees to hire to staff checkout lines with varying numbers of customers arriving throughout the day. Too few open lines means customers spend time waiting; too many, and the store loses money paying employees with no work to do. It’s also important to get the right mix of regular, express and self-serve checkout lines. Which combination is best depends on the needs of the store’s customers.

In this assignment, you’ll build an event-driven simulation for a grocery store, which could help in making these decisions. Your program will us data from input files to set up a simulation of customers and checkout lines, simulate a sequence of events, and report summary statistics after the simulation is complete.
